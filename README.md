Redo more on http://numeronesoft.ddns.net:8080

Then install wheelofnumfortune.avalonia

ATTENTION:
Avalonia is based on two native libraries libharfbuzzsharp e libskiasharp that aren't free software, so avalonia is not free software.

## Bugs

The multiline bug is resolved, however I see that there are some characters that are not corectly translated from json to system.string, so main features are not guaranteed.

The site on which the app takes it's cookie is changed, now it's allowed only one cookie for session. For changing cookie you have to restart the application.
